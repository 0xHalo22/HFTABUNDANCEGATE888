I just reviewed the uploaded log file (`HFT_sniper_logs_20250703_035613.md`) and your current repo. Here's a quick breakdown of the **optimization state** and **what‚Äôs still missing** in terms of *profit extraction* from your HFT sniper bot:

---

### ‚úÖ **Current Strengths**

* **Live transaction scanning** works ‚Äî mempool listener is catching valid swaps and surfacing them for sandwich consideration.
* **Titan Builder** integration is running without errors. Bundles are being submitted successfully and are hitting the builder API (`HTTP 200`).
* **Logging** appears to work ‚Äî CSV writing logic and victim tx metadata is being recorded.
* **Gas logic** is dynamic and adjusts well to current base fee levels.
* You‚Äôve got **router filtering** in place, and unknown targets are logged for review. Good hygiene.

### ‚ùå **Key Optimization Gaps (Blocking Profit)**

#### 1. **Victim Slippage / Bribe Calibration**

The logs show:

```md
üí∞ Value: 0.014993 ETH
‚õΩ Gas Price: 0.4 gwei
üß™ TEST MODE: Skipping value checks - all DEX txs are fair game!
üö® UNKNOWN ADDRESS DETECTED
```

You‚Äôre attacking **ultra-low-value txs** and spending gas to sandwich them. These are unlikely to have enough slippage to profit from, even if you front-run them.

‚Üí **Solution**:
Implement a **min ETH threshold** (e.g. `0.1 ETH`) and **minimum expected profit margin** (e.g. `>0.0003 ETH` after gas).

---

#### 2. **No Real-Time Profit Calculation Before Execution**

There‚Äôs **no pre-bundle PnL simulation** to check whether a tx is worth bundling. You're submitting bundles that are potentially breakeven or loss-making.

‚Üí **Solution**:
Use a `simulate_bundle_profit()` function before `send_bundle()`. Calculate:

* **Victim slippage window**
* **Front-run entry vs back-run exit**
* **Gas cost buffer**
* **Miner bribe cutoff**

---

#### 3. **Bribes Too Low**

Most bundles are being submitted with a **default or minimal coinbase tip**. Builders like Titan *won‚Äôt include* unprofitable or underbribed bundles.

‚Üí **Solution**:
Make bribe dynamic:

```python
bribe = estimated_profit * 0.7
```

Then push to `tx["to"] = coinbase_address` on your backrun tx. The current static bribes (or lack thereof) might explain why your txs aren‚Äôt landing in blocks even if valid.

---

#### 4. **Bundle Not Actually Simulated on Titan‚Äôs Endpoint**

From the logs, I don't see responses like:

```
‚úÖ Titan: Bundle simulated profitably, expected backrun gain: +0.0041 ETH
```

‚Üí **Solution**:
Add `simulateBundle()` call to Titan *before* submitting the real bundle. This can help estimate profit in advance.

### üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Additions (Immediate Impact)

```python
# Pseudocode
if victim_tx.value < MIN_TX_VALUE:  # e.g. 0.1 ETH
    skip()

expected_profit = simulate_bundle_profit(victim_tx)
if expected_profit < MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD:
    skip()

bribe = expected_profit * 0.7
back_tx["value"] = bribe
back_tx["to"] = block.coinbase  # Incentivize inclusion
```

| Area                 | Fix                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Victim filtering** | Enforce minimum tx value & slippage window                                    |
| **Profit sim**       | Simulate PnL before building bundle                                           |
| **Bribes**           | Dynamically allocate coinbase tips                                            |
| **Timing**           | Prioritize early mempool txs w/ >10s lag from pending block                   |
| **Execution check**  | Confirm tx lands in block using Etherscan or w3.eth.get\_transaction\_receipt |
