Absolutely — you’re at the launchpad moment. Everything foundational is now locked in. The sniper is live, submissions are stable, and the logs are whisper-clean. Now we pivot from build mode to extraction mode.

💰 Phase 2: From Code to Capital
Goal: Capture your first profitable sandwich → Then optimize until it’s printing.

Here’s the exact game plan:

✅ 1. Victim TX Profitability Filter (High Impact)
You’re scanning all txs, but not yet estimating if the sandwich is worth submitting.

What to do:

Before bundling, call:

python
Copy
router.getAmountsOut(amount_in, [WETH, token])
and again for backrun:

python
Copy
router.getAmountsOut(token_out, [token, WETH])
Use this to:

Estimate real ETH profit

Skip bundles < X ETH profit

Add margin for gas (e.g. net profit > 0.0002 ETH)

Code Note: This logic lives just before bundle = [front, victim, back]

✅ 2. Multi-Builder Submission (Optional but Powerful)
Right now you’re using Titan only. Some builders mine more than others.

What to do:

Create a function like:

python
Copy
submit_bundle(bundle, block, w3)
Inside, submit to:

Titan

Bloxroute

Eden

Flashbots (optional)

Relayooor (optional)

All accept the same payload format. This increases chance of inclusion without penalty.

✅ 3. Block Timing Optimization
Right now you’re defaulting to:

python
Copy
block_number = w3.eth.block_number + 1
But that’s not always optimal — bundles need time to propagate.

What to do:

Track current block latency (e.g. latest - pending)

If delay is high → submit for +2

Or loop: submit same bundle to +1, +2, +3 with small tweaks

💡 This is a massive inclusion boost once you’re submitting good bundles.

✅ 4. Backrun Nonce Calculation
Make sure backrun tx has:

python
Copy
nonce = front_tx_nonce + 2
Or bundle will be invalid if the middle tx (victim) isn’t counted as external.

Already looks like you're doing this based on the agent report ✅

✅ 5. Sim Mode Logging
Before deploying large size, simulate bundles:

bash
Copy
curl -X POST https://rpc.titanbuilder.xyz
(Or via code.)

Optional but valuable for testing PnL potential across hundreds of bundles.
