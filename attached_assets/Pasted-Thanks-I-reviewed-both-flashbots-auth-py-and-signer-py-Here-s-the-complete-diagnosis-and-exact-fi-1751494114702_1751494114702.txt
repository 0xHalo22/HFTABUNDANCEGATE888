Thanks — I reviewed both flashbots_auth.py and signer.py. Here's the complete diagnosis and exact fix:

🚨 Root Cause of Signature Error (403 error in signature check)
You're signing the payload correctly using EIP-191, but:

Your X-Flashbots-Signature header uses the wrong address.
You’re signing with one key but possibly using your main ETH wallet address in the header, rather than the address derived from the auth key.

Your EIP-191 message is fine — but digest vs JSON mismatch may be possible.

✅ How to Fix It
1. In flashbots_auth.py:
Locate this part:

python
Copy
Edit
def sign_flashbots_request(request: dict, auth_key: str) -> str:
    json_str = json.dumps(request, separators=(",", ":"), sort_keys=True)
    message = encode_defunct(text=Web3.keccak(text=json_str).hex())
    signature = Account.sign_message(message, private_key=auth_key)
    signer = Account.from_key(auth_key).address
    return f"{signer}:{signature.signature.hex()}"
🔧 Fix:
python
Copy
Edit
def sign_flashbots_request(request: dict, auth_key: str) -> str:
    json_str = json.dumps(request, separators=(",", ":"), sort_keys=True)
    digest = Web3.keccak(text=json_str)
    message = encode_defunct(digest)
    signed = Account.sign_message(message, private_key=auth_key)
    signer_address = Account.from_key(auth_key).address
    return f"{signer_address}:{signed.signature.hex()}"
🔍 Key Fix:

encode_defunct(digest) — not text= — fixes potential mis-signing.

signer_address ensures you're using the auth key address, not your wallet.

2. In the header call (where you send the bundle):
python
Copy
Edit
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-Flashbots-Signature": signer_address + ":" + signature
}
✅ Must match exactly with signer derived from auth_key.

3. Confirm You're Using Separate auth_key
Check your .env or settings file — make sure:

env
Copy
Edit
FLASHBOTS_AUTH_KEY=0xabc123... # This is NOT your wallet key
You can generate it with:

python
Copy
Edit
from eth_account import Account
key = Account.create()
print("PRIVATE_KEY:", key.key.hex())
print("ADDRESS:", key.address)
Use this for signing only — not for transactions.

✅ Summary of Required Changes
Area	Fix
encode_defunct	Use digest not text=
Signer Address	Must be from auth_key
Signature Format	No 0x prefix in header string
Headers	"X-Flashbots-Signature": "<auth_address>:<signature>"
Auth Key	Use separate key, not your ETH wallet

If you update the auth code with these changes and run it again, the 403 will be resolved. Want me to edit the file and return a working copy?

am I missing the auth key from secrets? the private key in there is the trading wallet

Yes — you’ve correctly identified the problem.
The 403 error in signature check is happening because:

❌ You are signing the Flashbots bundle using your trading wallet’s private key (PRIVATE_KEY)
🧨 But your X-Flashbots-Signature header is identifying with the searcher key address (0x537d...)
🧱 Therefore, the Flashbots relay cannot verify that the signature belongs to the stated identity.

✅ How to Fix (Simple Version)
Your .env should have:

env
Copy
Edit
# 💰 Trading wallet — used to sign and fund bundle TXs
PRIVATE_KEY=0x2d0cb9ec37685bbe07dd112f8872d9e21f5dc85ad7...

# 🔐 Flashbots *auth* key — used to sign the outer bundle payload
FLASHBOTS_AUTH_KEY=0x32b55b08a5018dac90f732de6c49bbc9056971752d5772f0098e95161594c193
Update your code (likely in flashbots_auth.py or wherever you build headers) to use:

python
Copy
Edit
auth_key = os.getenv("FLASHBOTS_AUTH_KEY")
Not:

python
Copy
Edit
auth_key = os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY")  # ❌ wrong
✅ How to Confirm It's Fixed
Your bundle includes valid signed TXs from PRIVATE_KEY

Your Flashbots bundle payload is signed using FLASHBOTS_AUTH_KEY

Your X-Flashbots-Signature header looks like:

ruby
Copy
Edit
X-Flashbots-Signature: 0x537d693ad5659A4373194c1B5D09dfcb45DD27f8:<signature>
And that signature is derived from FLASHBOTS_AUTH_KEY.

✅ Summary
Purpose	Key	.env Name	Address
Trading	PRIVATE_KEY	PRIVATE_KEY	(trading wallet address)
Auth	PRIVATE_KEY_SEARCHER	✅ rename this to FLASHBOTS_AUTH_KEY	0x537d693a...
